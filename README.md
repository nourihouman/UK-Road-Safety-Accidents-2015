UK Road Safety Analysis (2015 Data)

Project Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of road safety data from the UK, specifically focusing on data from the year 2015. The aim is to explore the relationship between various factors and road accidents, with a particular emphasis on the age of drivers and the severity of accidents.

Data Source

The dataset is sourced from the UK Department of Transport's open data on road safety. It covers detailed information about road accidents, including data on vehicles involved and casualties reported for the year 2015.

Average Severity by Age of Driver: This analysis focuses on understanding the average severity of road accidents across different driver age groups.
Count of Severity by Age Range: This involves counting the number of accidents with different severity levels within specific age groups.
Total Accidents by Age of Driver: This analysis looks at the total number of accidents that involve drivers of each age group.
